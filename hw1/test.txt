You have probably been using gcc to compile your programs but this grows
tedious and complicated as the number of files you need to compile increases.
For this assignment, you will need to write a Makefile that compiles main.c,
wc.c, and map.c when make is run (you may want to add the -g gcc flag to this
step). It may also help to write a clean target (for make clean) to remove your
binaries, but this is optional. If all of this is new to you please read 2.2
make.
